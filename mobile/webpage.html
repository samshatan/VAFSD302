        <h2 style="text: centre">First Visit to Mondstadt</h2>
        <p>The City of Freedom, the Crown of the North, the Romantic City of Pastorals â€” these are names heralded by poets and artists alike for the renowned city of Mondstadt.<br>    I am devoted to poetry, music, wine, and festivities as much as the next bard; they are literally and metaphorically the sustenance of my life. Therefore, just as any bard would be, I am drawn to Mondstadt like a moth to a flame.<br>What caught my attention recently was the sightings of a dragon near Mondstadt. This has had the city folk wrapped in rumors and speculations, myself included. Maybe my curiosity got the better of me, or perhaps I too have the blood of an adventurer inside of me, for I am determined to venture forth to the City of Freedom that I have yearned for for so long.</p>
